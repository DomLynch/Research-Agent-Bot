# PROJECT_STATE.md

## Current Objective
**Proof 001 — Metformin Claim Court.** Build a deterministic claim-court pipeline that produces one publishable metformin artifact end-to-end (`paper.md` + 7 mandatory JSON receipts). The agent compiles structured evidence; SPAR adjudicates; markdown is rendering, not source of truth. Three greens (metformin → rapamycin → everolimus) before any RFC outreach.

Full design: [`docs/DESIGN-001.md`](docs/DESIGN-001.md) (DRAFT v2, sign-off pending).

## Pipeline (Proof 001, 9 stages)
```
topic_pack ingest (toml)  →  retrieve  →  evidence_cards (registry override → deterministic) →
fact extraction (LLM proposes, schema disposes)  →  claim_graph compile  →
thesis tournament (6-dim, deterministic selector)  →  citation_trace (TrialRegistryClient /
DrugAliasClient / LiteratureClient — MCP/httpx/fixture backends)  →  SPAR (3 agents,
explicit tie-break, dissent always published)  →  drafting (claim-graph-guarded prose)  →
render + bundle
```

## Hard rule
```
LLM PROPOSES. CODE DISPOSES.
- Role assignment: registry override > deterministic abstract classifier. Never LLM.
- Fact identity: extracted by LLM, schema-validated, source-text-traced.
- Claim membership in paper.md: gated by claim_graph.json. LLM cannot add claims.
```

## Constraints
- Hard ceiling: **4,800 LOC runtime** for `agent/` (raised from 3,500 to fund the claim-court features per DECISIONS.md 2026-04-27). Test LOC budgeted separately.
- Soft per-file budget: **300 LOC** (v4 Rule 54).
- Soft per-function budget: **50 LOC** (v4 Rule 54).
- Runtime dep: `httpx` only. **Topic packs use stdlib `tomllib` (TOML, not YAML)** — no PyYAML.
- Python ≥ 3.11, stdlib `dataclasses` (frozen+slots).

## Status — 2026-04-27 — Day 3.2a deterministic compiler shipped; Day 3.2b/c (LLM stage) pending

**State verified through:** the most recent entry in the commit log table below.
*Structural break (Day 3.1-fixes-2): the previous "State verified through: \<hash\>"
field was reintroducing drift on every slice because each slice's commit hash
isn't known until after the commit lands. The commit log table IS the canonical
source of truth — pointing at "the most recent entry" is self-correcting:
`git log -1 --oneline` matches the table's bottom row, no manual sync required.*
*(field describes state up to and including the most recent commit listed
in the log table below. The current HEAD will appear in the next slice's
update. See commit message of e1bb56f for the amend-bootstrap rationale.)*

**Tag:** `v1.1-final` → `89ee064` (preserves V1.1 LLM-coupled state for archaeology)
**Tests:** 341/341 passing in 0.39s. ruff clean. git diff --check clean.
**Runtime LOC:** 4,088 / 4,800 ceiling (15% headroom)

**Archived to `agent_archived/proof001/`** (per [FAILURES/research-agent-v1.md](FAILURES/research-agent-v1.md)):
- 6 modules: `relevance.py`, `llm.py`, `judge.py`, `draft.py`, `qa.py`, `app.py`
- 3 test files: `test_judge.py`, `test_draft.py`, `test_qa.py`
- Reason: LLMs were inside the trust spine; structural bug class V1.1 could not close.

**Active `agent/` (post-Day 2.4):**
- `types.py` (KEEP — frozen-dataclass invariants, role↔fact-kind pairing)
- `retrieve.py` + `sources/` (KEEP — async parallel retrieval, 4 adapters)
- `schemas.py` (Day 1 — 6 frozen-dataclasses, ClaimGraph + SPAR invariants, tie-break, dissent membership/minority guard)
- `topic_pack.py` (Day 1 — stdlib `tomllib` loader, MappingProxyType-protected overrides)
- `text_signals.py` (Day 2.1 — regex/marker constants extracted from bundle.py)
- `role_classifier.py` (Day 2.1 — `classify_role` + `classify_design`)
- `evidence_cards.py` (Day 2.1 — renamed from bundle.py; `bundle()` builder + tier/direct/strict + risk_of_bias + confidence_verdict + rank_for_writer + topic_pack-aware override gate)
- `registry_overrides.py` (Day 2.2 — registry-pinned override layer; the moat)
- `validators.py` (Day 2.3 — pure-function gates: verb-ban, role-claim-match, alias-drift, p-value-in-source; Day 3.1 promoted `PVALUE_RE` to public for citation_trace reuse)
- `trace_clients.py` (Day 2.4 — 3 Protocols (TrialRegistryClient / DrugAliasClient / LiteratureClient) + fixture backends + env-var selectors; httpx + MCP backends ship Day 3.3)
- `citation_trace.py` (Day 3.1 — moat orchestrator; 5 trace functions [nct_exists, role_match, p_value_in_text, percentage_in_text, alias_match] + trace_claim + trace_claim_graph + summary; closes external layers for planted cases 2/3/4. Day 3.1-fixes: nct_exists yields per-id traces from source.nct + URL ISRCTN + abstract-NCTs; flags has_results=False contradiction for published_results role; alias_match skips canonical trial acronyms)
- `compiler.py` (Day 3.2a — deterministic facts → Claims → ClaimGraph: 1:1 fact-to-claim mapping, kind→claim_type / role+direct→directness / (role,design,tier)→confidence; thesis-pick by score tuple (directness, tier, confidence, claim_id); CompileError on orphan refs; LLM fact-extraction lands in 3.2c)
- `render.py` (GUT on Day 5 — pure claim_graph → markdown, no LLM hooks)
- `settings.py` (KEEP, may extend `TRACE_BACKEND` documentation)
- `app.py` (deploy-safe stub — HTTP 503 paused page)

`bundle.py` was renamed via `git mv` to `evidence_cards.py` and refactored to import from the 3 new sibling modules.

**Runtime status — distinguish two states:**

| State | What's there | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub `main`** (latest commit-log entry) | Deploy-safe stub. `agent.app dashboard` serves HTTP 503 "service paused". | `python -m agent.app dashboard --port 8791` then `curl :8791/` → 503 |
| **VPS live (`research-agent.domlynch.com`)** | **Still V1.1** — deploy step pending since Day 0 push (2026-04-27). | `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://research-agent.domlynch.com/` → `200` until the VPS pulls. |

To deploy the stub: SSH into VPS, `cd /opt/research-agent-bot && git pull && systemctl restart research-agent-bot`. Reverts to V1.1 via `git checkout v1.1-final && systemctl restart research-agent-bot`. Either path is reversible.

**Planted-failure case status (post-Day 3.1) — all 5 cases caught at multiple layers:**

| Case | What | Local layers (live) | Fixture layer (Day 2.4) | External layer (Day 3.1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TAME protocol cited as results | **TRIPLE-LOCKED:** ✅ `topic_pack` whitelist + ✅ `evidence_cards` registry override (incl. abstract NCT scan) + ✅ `validators.check_verb_ban` prose-level | ✅ `FixtureTrialRegistryClient` returns TAME with `has_results=False` | ✅ **`citation_trace.trace_nct_exists` FAILS** when `item.role='published_results'` AND `record.has_results=False` (4th defense — protocol-as-results contradiction at trace layer) |
| 2 | Fabricated NCT | — | ✅ `FixtureTrialRegistryClient.get_trial("NCT99999999") → None` (planted absence) | ✅ **`citation_trace.trace_nct_exists` → `passed=False`** |
| 3 | Inflated p-value | ✅ `validators.check_p_value_in_source` (local exact-match) | — | ✅ **`citation_trace.trace_p_value_in_text` per-pvalue trace** |
| 4 | Alias drift ("Glufomin") | ✅ `topic_pack` alias whitelist + ✅ `validators.check_alias_drift` (apposition pattern) | ✅ `FixtureDrugAliasClient.lookup("Glufomin") → None` | ✅ **`citation_trace.trace_alias_match` → `passed=False`** |
| 5 | Off-domain extrapolation | ✅ `evidence_cards` topic-anchor gate + ✅ `validators.check_role_claim_match` directness contract | — | ✅ `citation_trace.trace_role_match` re-checks at trace time |

## Day plan (5 days, target — not deadline)
| Day | Ship | Done when | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | Tag `v1.1-final`. Archive 6 LLM-coupled modules + 3 test files. Deploy-safe `app.py` stub. Post-mortem. DECISIONS.md entry. | Tag exists; deterministic tests green; `agent.app dashboard` runs as paused-stub. | ✅ `d941ae2` |
| **1** | `schemas.py` + `topic_pack.py` + `topic_packs/metformin.toml` + planted-failure fixtures + tests. Bundle.py 4-file split DEFERRED to Day 2 (paired with evidence_cards rename). | All 6 schemas frozen, `tomllib` parses topic pack, planted-failure cases 1+4 caught at topic_pack layer. | ✅ `a9eb7ab` + `941f21c` + `9cff619` |
| **2** | `evidence_cards.py` (refactor of bundle.py) + 4-file split + registry_overrides + `validators.py` + `compiler.py` (deterministic) + `trace_clients.py` fixture backend. Real metformin retrieval E2E. | ≥12 sources retrieved; cards classify correctly; planted case 1 caught at evidence_cards (in addition to topic_pack layer). | **✅ COMPLETE (fixture + live both green after Day 3.0)** — 2.1+2.2 `0ffcd5a` + 2.3 `9918c12` + 2.4 `e1bb56f` + 2.4-fixes `5b06bda` + 2.5 fixture-replay `c0cc11e` (40 sources, MASTERS pinned, perf 0.4 ms / 11.1 ms) + 2.5b live `7fe3c02` (script + baseline) + Day 3.0 abstract-NCT fix `555c73a` (live MASTERS now pinned to published_results / A1) |
| 3 | `citation_trace.py` against `trace_clients.py` (fixture + httpx backends). MCP backend wired but optional. **First LLM stage:** fact extraction (LLM proposes, schema disposes). | Citation_trace catches planted cases 2, 3; httpx backend smoke-tests against clinicaltrials.gov. | **PARTIAL** — 3.0 `555c73a` (abstract NCT scan) + 3.0-fixes `979055b` (case-insensitive) + 3.0-state `361f5f7` + 3.1 `788868a` (citation_trace.py: cases 2/3/4 caught at external layer) + 3.1-fixes `af2e329` (3 P1 trust-spine fixes) + 3.1-fixes-2 `0a2c263` (state-drift structural break) + **3.2a deterministic compiler** (this slice — facts → Claims → ClaimGraph with thesis-pick); 3.2b llm_client + 3.2c LLM fact-extraction + 3.3 httpx/MCP backends + 3.4 E2E ☐ pending |
| 4 | `thesis_tournament.py` + `spar.py` + writer prompt with quality-bar block + judge checklist. Plant-corpus prompt iteration. `gap_analysis.py` only if time permits (non-gating). | All 5 planted failures caught; thesis tournament selects defensible thesis on real corpus. | — |
| 5 | `submit_adapter.py` + gutted `render.py` + new `app.py` + `mcp_server.py` + first end-to-end metformin run. | `runs/metformin-001/` contains 8 mandatory outputs; SPAR verdict accept_clean or accept_caveated; quality bar met against MASTERS / MET-PREVENT / Konopka 2019 standard. | — |

## Eval gates (Proof 001 ship criteria)
- Role accuracy 10/10 (no protocol cited as result; every NCT in topic pack hits override)
- Citation accuracy 10/10 (every NCT/DOI resolves; every numeric traces to source)
- Numeric fidelity 9/10
- Directness discipline 10/10
- Planted failures 5/5 caught at the gate they should be caught at
- Final artifact quality 8.5+/10 against the 7-paper Quality Reference Corpus
- Receipt completeness 8/8 mandatory (paper.md + 7 JSON; gap_analysis.json bonus 9th)

## Stop conditions
- Proof 001 fails any gate → iterate Proof 001. **Do not start rapamycin.**
- 001 + 002 green, 003 (everolimus) red → likely topic-pack issue (RAD001 alias, oncology indirectness). Fix and re-run.
- All 3 green → publish RFCs. Until then, no outreach.
- Cost per run >$0.05 sustained → re-route Mistral judge calls; if still >$0.05, switch to Gemma self-host before continuing.

## Archived V1.1 status (preserved for archaeology)
- V1.1 shipped 2026-04-26 at commit `89ee064` (now tagged `v1.1-final`).
- Three-LLM pipeline: relevance (MiMo→Gemma→Mistral) + writer (MiMo→Mistral) + judge (Gemma→MiMo→Mistral).
- 166 tests green, deployed at `research-agent.domlynch.com`, $0.002–0.005 per draft.
- **Why archived:** LLMs were inside the trust spine; categorical decisions (role assignment, citation identity, final adjudication) cannot be reliably routed through model judgment. Three failure modes never closed: protocol-as-results, mechanism-inflated-to-clinic, off-domain extrapolation. Full post-mortem in [`FAILURES/research-agent-v1.md`](FAILURES/research-agent-v1.md).

## Legacy
The pre-V1.1 codebase remains at `agent_legacy/` for git archaeology. The Day 0 V1.1 archive is at `agent_archived/proof001/`. New code MUST NOT import from either. CI guard: `tests/test_no_legacy_imports.py` blocks both packages with three targeted tests (combined, legacy-only, archived-only).

## Next validation step

**Day 3.2 — split into 3.2a / 3.2b / 3.2c.** 3.2a shipped (this slice). Next: 3.2b.

(a) **Deterministic compiler** ✅ (this slice — `agent/compiler.py`, 233 LOC + 26 tests):
facts → Claims → ClaimGraph. Pure function; no LLM. 1:1 mapping by Fact;
deterministic claim_id (C001…); kind→claim_type, (role+direct)→directness,
(role,design,tier)→confidence. Thesis pick by score tuple
(directness, tier, confidence, claim_id) — direct A1 high wins. CompileError
on orphan refs / empty input. Edges populated by Day 4 SPAR.

(b) **`agent/llm_client.py`** ☐ (next): httpx OpenAI-compatible wrapper with
MiMo V2.5-Pro primary + Mistral Small 4 fallback chain. Single dependency
surface for all LLM calls. Includes timeout / retry / cost-tagging. No
provider SDKs — httpx only per repo's runtime-dep constraint.

(c) **First LLM stage — fact extraction** ☐: LLM prompt that reads the
abstract of each `published_results` evidence item and proposes
(claim_text, p_value, outcome, estimate) tuples. **LLM never decides role
or claim_type** — those are pinned by upstream layers. Schema disposes:
every numeric must trace via `validators.check_p_value_in_source` or
`citation_trace.trace_p_value_in_text` before the fact is accepted.

Done-when (3.2 as a whole):
- Compiler builds a ClaimGraph from real metformin evidence (≥6 claims) ✅ (deterministic path proven, fact source pending 3.2c)
- First-LLM stage proposes facts + schema rejects fabrications ☐
- Performance baseline: per-fact extraction cost + total compile time ☐

After 3.2: 3.3 wires real httpx + MCP backends for `trace_clients.py`. 3.4 final Day 3 E2E.
